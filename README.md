# loadgen

## build

```shell
make
```

## example:

```shell
# bench const SQL qps
bin/loadgen bench --sql "select * from t" --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4000 --db test --thread 5

# bench rand SQL qps, use `#rand-val` to generate rand value, the rand value is between `valmin` and `valmax`
bin/loadgen bench --sql "select * from t where id=#rand-val" --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4000 --db test --thread 5 --valmin=0 --valmax=100

# use bench command to create 10000 tables. the `#seq-val` is a sequence value, from `valmin` to `valmax`
bin/loadgen bench --sql " create table if not exists t#seq-val (a int key, b int)" --valmin 0 --valmax 10000 --thread 1

# generate payload: full table scan with aggregation
# the SQL is select sum(a+b+e), sum(a*b), sum(a*e), sum(b*e), sum(a*b*e) from test.t_full_table_scan; 
# the total table rows is 1000
bin/loadgen payload full-table-scan --rows=1000

# generate payload: full table scan without aggregation
# the SQL is select * from test.t_full_table_scan;
# the total table rows is 100
bin/loadgen payload full-table-scan --rows=100 --agg=false


# generate payload: full index lookup with aggregation
# the SQL is select sum(a+e), max(c) from test.t_full_index_lookup use index (idx0);
# the total table rows is 100
bin/loadgen payload full-index-lookup --rows 100

# generate payload: full index scan with aggregation
# the SQL is select sum(b), avg(b), min(b), max(b) from test.t_full_index_scan use index (idx0);
# the total table rows is 10000
bin/loadgen payload full-index-scan --rows 10000
```
